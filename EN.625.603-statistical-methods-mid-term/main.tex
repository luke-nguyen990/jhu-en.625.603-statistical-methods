        \textbf{Question 1} \\
        Suppose that a telephone number is 534-0826. If the first 3 digits of this number are written
        down in random order and then the last 4 digits of this number are written down in random order
        in an attempt to obtain the correct telephone number, what is the probability of each of the
        following events?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item All 7 digits are correctly placed.
            \item The first 3 digits are correctly placed and only 2 of the remaining digits are
                  incorrectly placed.
        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Probability the first 3 digits are correctly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \frac{1}{3!} = \frac{1}{6}
                  \end{align*}
                  Probability the last 4 digits are correctly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \frac{1}{4!} = \frac{1}{24}
                  \end{align*}
                  We observed that the order of the first 3 digits and the last 4 digits are independent. Thus the probability of all 7 digits are correctly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{24} =  \boldsymbol{\frac{1}{144}}
                  \end{align*}
            \item The number of ways for 2 digits to be incorrectly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \binom{4}{2} = 6
                  \end{align*}
                  The probability of 2 digits out of the last 4 digits are incorrectly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \frac{6}{4!} = \frac{1}{4}
                  \end{align*}
                  The probability of the first 3 digits are correctly placed and only 2 of the remaining digits are incorrectly placed is
                  \begin{align*}
                      \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{4} = \boldsymbol{\frac{1}{24}}
                  \end{align*}

        \textbf{Question 2} \\
        Given a collection of seven people, in which three are Data Science majors and four are ACM
        majors. If a committee of three people is picked at random, what is the probability that the
        committee contains one Data Science major and two ACM majors?

        \textbf{Solution} \\
        The number of ways to pick a committee of three people from seven people where one of them is data sience major and two of them are ACM majors is
        \begin{align*}
            \binom{3}{1} \times \binom{4}{2} = 3 \times 6 = 18
        \end{align*}
        The number of ways to pick a committe of three people from seven people is
        \begin{align*}
            \binom{7}{3} = 35
        \end{align*}
        The probability that the committee contains one Data Science major and two ACM majors is
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{18}{35} = \boldsymbol{\frac{18}{35}}

        \textbf{Question 3} \\
        Ninety percent of the disk drives manufactured by the COMDISK Company are known to
        function properly. For a collection of 18 disk drives, find the probability that at least 15 function
        properly.

        \textbf{Solution} \\
        Let $X$ be the number of disk drives that function properly. $X$ is a binomial random variable with $n = 18$ and $p = 0.9$. The probability that at least 15 function properly is
        \begin{align*}
            P(X \ge 15) & = \sum_{k=15}^{18} \binom{18}{k} (0.9)^k (0.1)^{18-k}                                                                                                   \\
                        & = \binom{18}{15} (0.9)^{15} (0.1)^{3} + \binom{18}{16} (0.9)^{16} (0.1)^{2} + \binom{18}{17} (0.9)^{17} (0.1)^{1} + \binom{18}{18} (0.9)^{18} (0.1)^{0} \\
                        & = 0.168 + 0.284 + 0.300 + 0.150                                                                                                                         \\

        \textbf{Question 4} \\
        A certain construction company buys 20\%, 30\%, and 50\% of their nails from hardware suppliers
        A, B, and C, respectively. Suppose it is known that 0.5\%, .02\%, and .01\% of the nails from A, B,
        and C respectively are defective. If a nail purchased by the construction company is defective,
        what is the probability that it came from supplier C? \\
        \textbf{Solution} \\
        Probability that a nail purchased by the construction company is defective is
        \begin{align*}
            P(\text{defective}) & = P(\text{defective} | \text{A}) P(\text{A}) + P(\text{defective} | \text{B}) P(\text{B}) + P(\text{defective} | \text{C}) P(\text{C}) \\
                                & = 0.5\% \times 20\% + 0.02\% \times 30\% + 0.01\% \times 50\%                                                                          \\
                                & = 0.00111                                                                                                                              \\
        \end{align*}
        Applying Bayes' theorem, the probability that a nail purchased by the construction company is from supplier C given that it is defective is
        \begin{align*}
            P(\text{C} | \text{defective}) & = \frac{P(\text{defective} | \text{C}) P(\text{C})}{P(\text{defective})} \\
                                           & = \frac{0.005\%}{0.00111}                                                \\
                                           & = \boldsymbol{0.045}

                  \begin{align*}

        \textbf{Question 9} \\
        In a gambling game, five fair coins are tossed. For a bet of \$5, a gambler will win \$10 if three
        heads occur. Otherwise, the gambler loses the \$5 bet. What is the expected gain for a typical
        bet of \$5.
        \textbf{Solution} \\
        Probability of winning \$10 is
        \begin{align*}
            P(\text{win}) & = \binom{5}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \\

        The expected gain for a typical bet of \$5 is
        \begin{align*}
            E(\text{gain}) & = 10 \times P(\text{win}) - 5 \times P(\text{lose}) \\

        Derive Bayes Theorem given in Theorem 2.4.2 on page 45. \\

            P(A_j | B) & = \frac{P(B | A_j) P(A_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B | A_i) P(A_i)}
        \end{align*}
        \textbf{Solution} \\
        Refer to the Definition 2.4.1 of conditional probability, we have the following
        \begin{align*}
            P(A_j | B) & = \frac{P(A_j \cap B)}{P(B)}                \\
                       & = \frac{P(B | A_j) P(A_j)}{P(B)} \qquad (1)
        \end{align*}
        Refer to the Theorem 2.4.1 of the law of total probability, we have the following
        \begin{align*}
            P(B) & = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B | A_i) P(A_i) \qquad (2)
        \end{align*}
        From (1), (2), we derives Bayes Theorem in Theorem 2.4.2 as follows
        \begin{align*}
            P(A_j | B) & = \frac{P(B | A_j) P(A_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B | A_i) P(A_i)}
